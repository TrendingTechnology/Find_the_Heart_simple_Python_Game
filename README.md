# Find_the_Heart_simple_Python_Game
This is a simple Python game for finding a heart emoji. There is a 3 x 3 matrix in which a heart emoji resides. The location of the heart is randomized and is not revealed. The player must guess the location of the heart inside this matrix by typing in coordinates of row and column. For example, if the player suspects that the heart is located in the second row and second column, the player must type in "22" (for 2nd row and 2nd column, respectively).
