# Find_the_Heart_simple_Python_Game
This is a simple Python game for finding a heart emoji (ðŸ’–). There is a 3 x 3 matrix in which a heart emoji resides. The location of the heart is randomized and is not revealed. The matrix is originally veiled by blue squares (ðŸŸ¦) and infested with aliens (ðŸ‘¾). The player must guess the location of the heart inside this matrix by typing in coordinates of row and column. For example, if the player suspects that the heart is located in the second row and second column, the player must type in "22" (for 2nd row and 2nd column, respectively).

In each game, the player has only 3 chances to guess the location of the heart. These 3 chances are represented by 3 drops of blood (ðŸ©¸ðŸ©¸ðŸ©¸). Each time the player guesses wrong, he/she loses 1 drop of blood. When the player used up all the bloods, the game is over and the computer will asks if the player wants to play another game.

On the other hand, the game is also over when the player guesses the right location of the heart. The computer will also asks if the player wants to play again or not.

Once the player chooses not to play anymore, the computer will give a summary message of how many games the player has played, and how many times he/she has won or lost, in a grammatically correct way.
